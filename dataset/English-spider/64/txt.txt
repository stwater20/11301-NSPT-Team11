A massive data breach originating from a private industry contractor of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security (MPS), known as iSoon (also referred to as Anxun), has surfaced on GitHub. The Ministry of Public Security breach included a substantial amount of sensitive information, potentially impacting various facets of espionage operations.

The leaked data in the alleged MPS data leak encompassed a range of mixed contents, including but not limited to spyware, details on espionage operations, and even references to a purported “Twitter Monitoring Platform”. This MPS data breach mirrored the magnitude of the NTC Vulkan leak, indicating the severity and potential consequences of the incident.

The Cyber Express team investigated the leak and found that the vast amounts of the data included 66 links on a GitHub repository named I-S00N. The user behind this massive leak says that “上海安洵信息内幕. 上海安洵信息不靠谱, 坑国家政府机关. 安洵背后的真相. 安洵忽悠国家安全机关”, which translates to “Shanghai Anxun Information Insider. Shanghai Anxun’s information is unreliable and is a trap for national government agencies. The truth behind An Xun.”

The conversation also touched on challenges such as resource allocation, concerns about pricing and quality, and communication difficulties with certain contacts.

Moreover, another interesting fact about the conversations in this MPS data breach is that the logs dates back to 2018 and covers a large amount of sensitive information with multiple vendors from China and other nations. 

APT Cyberattacks on China
In 2023, 360 Security Group’s annual cybersecurity report revealed over 1,200 APT attacks on China by 13 foreign organizations, primarily from North America and Asia. These attacks spanned 16 industries, with education being the most targeted.

APT organizations, often state-backed, posed threats beyond espionage, potentially paralyzing a nation’s infrastructure. The US-led attacks were noted for their sophistication and global reach, affecting internet and IoT assets worldwide.

A total of 731 APT reports, exposing 135 organizations, were released globally, with 54 identified by 360. Notably, China’s education and scientific research sectors were heavily targeted, with government agencies also under persistent attack. Geographically, attacks were concentrated in China’s southeastern coastal and high-tech regions.

US policies, particularly against China’s tech sector, fueled increased attacks, notably on-chip, and 5G industries. These attacks aligned with political agendas to stifle China’s high-tech advancement. Furthermore, APT groups targeted China’s geological surveying fields, posing conventional espionage threats.

An attack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center highlighted the potential national security risks. Experts advocated for meticulous incident tracking and AI-driven defense systems, urging collaborative efforts to counter cyber threats effectively.
