A massive data leak originating from Chinese cybersecurity vendor I-Soon has exposed the extent of its involvement in global surveillance operations, including targeting countries such as Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and the UK.
The leaked information, comprising approximately 190 megabytes of data, recently surfaced on code-sharing platform GitHub, offering a glimpse into the inner workings of China's state-sponsored cyber apparatus.
