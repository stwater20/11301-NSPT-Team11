A trove of leaked documents showed the inner workings of a private Chinese hacking company utilized by the Chinese government, multiple outlets reported.

Two employees with private security contractor I-Soon confirmed with the Associated Press the validity of the documents, which were published publicly online late last week.

As analysts rush to analyze the 190-megabyte leak that includes contracts, presentations and client lists, experts say the dump is significant for providing a rare look at the tactics used by Chinese authorities to monitor people, governments and organizations around the world, the AP reported.

Chinese police are investigating the leak and it was not immediately clear who released the documents.

Here is what to know we know so far about the leak and some early revelations about hackers' tactics and targets:

What is I-Soon?
I-Soon, also known as Anxun Xinxi, offers information technology services consulting services, according to Crunchbase. The company's website was disabled as of Wednesday.
The Chinese Ministry of Public Security was at the top of the list of clients on I-Soon's previously available website, along with more than 50 regional security agencies in the country, the AP reported.

The company is based in Shanghai and sells third-party hacking services, the Washington Post reported.

The document leak does not include the data obtained though the hacking services, but rather shows insight on how the operation worked and for whom.

Hacking offerings revealed by leaked documents
The New York Times, which reviewed the leaked documents, found I-Soon provided the following services:
